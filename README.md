# Homage^2

This project is an exploration of Rust and Wasm by implementing a twist on [Homage to the Square]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_to_the_Square), a Bauhaus-era series of paintings by Josef
Albers. The original series of paintings explored color and the way colors interact and relate to
other colors through the framework of nested squares, and in this project the goal was to do
something similar but with fragment shaders.

I used the `wgpu` library, with heavy guidance from the [Learn Wgpu]
(https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) tutorial. The library is used to set up a graphics pipeline,
and the square geometries are created by passing the corner points into the vertex buffer. Colors
are assigned per-vertex (one random RGB color per square by default), and a fragment shader
oscillates the R, G, and B channels along different time-based sinusoids to create a glowing
effect.

### Spice

The app supports a `spice` query parameter, currently supporting values from 1 to 4. The values
dictate the probability (`spice` * 25%) that a given square will have a gradient instead of a
solid color. These gradients are generated by choosing random points in HSL space with a
saturation value of 100 and a lightness value of 40, which produced a better set of gradient
colors than random points in RGB.

## Build and run locally
